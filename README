Mission Probable:
- Get it working - foo.h foo.c main.c - in a new folder
- Compile use the flags for the debugger - remember what they are?
- Change foo's to addme's
- Save copy Get it working
- Get one user input to replace int y in main.c - add 8 (not 5) // see demoin.c - Save copy Get it working
- Comment your understanding of how all this works
- Create a pdf with lots of screen shots and comments submit as fname123456_hw1A.pdf

Part B
- Now into the internals time to use gdb to explore this source code thoughts
- Tell the story of what this code is doing. For example,
- What is the address space of the code, function, variables?
- What can you change while running?
- Comment your understanding of how all this works
- Create a pdf with lots of screen shots and comments submit as fname123456_hw1B.pdf

disable -> disable a breakpoint.
enable –> enable a disabled breakpoint.
next or n -> executes next line of code, but don’t dive into functions.
step –> go to next instruction, diving into the function.
list or l –> displays the code.
print or p –> used to display the stored value.
quit or q –> exits out of gdb.
clear –> to clear all breakpoints.
continue –> continue normal execution.
